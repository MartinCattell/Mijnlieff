# Mijnlieff
The board game Mijnlieff built using Tkinter in Python. TKinter is not made for games but I'm using it mainly as a platform from which 
to practise various programming techniques. I plan to have save/load options, player profiles and ultimately an online mode but, for now,
I'm just learning while having fun.
